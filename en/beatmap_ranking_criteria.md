#### Rules

1. Map must be playable, still following Bancho Ranking Criteria. If not, they should be going to Loved.
2. Easly Abuseable Longstream map will goes to loved. (It happens because many Relax player using DT to gain PP)
3. Overlap object, 2B maps, Storyboard based maps (Map that needs storyboard to be playable) will go to Loved.
4. Near impossible map (Galaxy Collapse, .etc) that can be finised by a player will be ranked.
5. Marathon map that more than 40 minutes length (or if it touch the limit of STD score) will go to Loved.  (examples: Songs Compilation nya Nevo, Length 54 minutes)

#### RANKED

 1. PLAYABLE this one is a must, what mean playable is that it can be at least played by a casual player (player with average skill that not really care about PP)
 2. Less Unecessary Overstream note, as said it will take some times to check this criteria (possibly will be ranked)
 3. Unique & Variative patterns not too monotone but still can have a chance to be ranked
 4. METADATA like OD AR HP can be consideration material

#### LOVED

 1. Unique Patterns is a big plus
 2. Playable Monotone and interesting patterns
 3. METADATA not really take point here as long as it not interfere the gameplay

#### NOTE

- more and less can be considerated (SR also a consideration material)
- unplayable will absolutely be denied except someone can pass it (going to **LOVED** category)
- training map pack will going to LOVED category same as osu!mania Rules
- Because of this RC are more flexible than official osu has, chart with Length under 5 menit even if it has less than 2 difficulty that have the ranked criteria will be approved with the consideration written above
- old pattern (ex. Deif's maps on years 2014 below) can still be considerated for ranked

#### RULES

1. Playable, and it a must, if not playable it will be going to loved
2. Less 1/4+1/6 and  1/6+1/8 pattern, take that as consideration before submitting a request if you want it to be ranked, but it still can be loved
3. Longstream is fine, but stable, yea if stable 1/4 atau 1/6 longstream maybe no problem, but 1/4+1/6 still be approved if the pattern 1/6 position is on the end of the stream, for 1/6 in the middle of the stream and continued by 1/4 stream might be going to loved
4. Endurance map, if the map has longstream without any break time dan more than 2 minutes length and/or stamina map with high bpm might also goes to loved, for stamina map but the bpm is under 250 still can be considerated
5. Mapset with Difficulty SpeedRate, Mapset with many Diff Rate prefered going to loved
6. Doublet spam, definetly loved
7. Pattern with random slider appear or Pattern inside the slider, this also goint to loved, sometimes the pattern on the slider can't be clicked
8. Spinner Spamming, if this is too much can decrease gauge significantly, of course going to loved
9. Invisible Pattern, this kind of pattern usualy needs storyboard,  and it's Aspire tipe maps, of course Loved
10. Metadata, this one  is also consideration material for ranking purpose

#### OVERALL

1. **Vibro = NO**
2. Playable Pattern, what it means is it has to be playable, the pattern can be played by a player and it fits the Official RC. 
3. Map Pack (Endurance, Dan, Course) = Loved, as said on the title, training pack is a bunch of maps that made for training purpose and not for casual playing
4. For 7K beatmaps that have SR>5, the minimum requirement is HP 7 and OD 7.

Notes: How good or not the map is, is subjective, i'm here as a mapper still can't yet find maps with good patterns, so please understand. Playable pattern is also the same, even a map with SR 7 can be considered playable for some player, and not for the others. except VIBRO

#### LN MAPS

1. For the rate up/speed up won't be ranked because the pattern is just the same. 
2. For maps that have SR >9 will be pending or Loved. there's different case for 7K. For 7k, for now SR>15 will be Pending or Loved
3. For 7K LN beatmaps that have SR>6, the minimum requirement is HP 6.5 and OD 0. Also if the Map has SR>12 with DT/NC Mods specifically for "Easy" Beatmaps, then it can't be ranked (By "Easy" is that it abuses the SR system with spammable pattern to get high SR)

Notes: FOR this LN rules might change anytime
